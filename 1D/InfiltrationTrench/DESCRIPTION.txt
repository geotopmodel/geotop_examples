This is an example GEOtop dataset intended to reproduce the Wierenga et
al. (1991) WRR infiltration trench experiment conducted at Las Cruces.

Infiltration is applied to the land surface at a rate of 1.82 cm/day for
86 days, while plastic sheeting is used to remove any other fluxes at 
the land surface (e.g. precipitation and evaporation). Soil moisture 
sensors at a variety of depths measured water content throughout the
experiment, and observations are reported for days 19 and 35.

Created by Sam Zipper, February 2017, in order to learn how to build the
inputs for a GEOtop simulation.
